Planfree.dev came about whilst working at Netcall, my team were using existing planning poker websites and were constantly frustrated at all the paywalls we had to deal with. So I decided to build my own and see how it went. To begin with just my team used planfree.dev every other week during our planning meetings, now 100s of budding estimators jump in each day!

#### History of planfree
If you're interested I have a blog website at Codeheir.com. I wrote a blog when I first released planfree.dev that you can find here as well as update blogs such as Planfree goes Heroku that talks through some of the deployment decisions made.
