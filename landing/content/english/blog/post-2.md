You know that feeling: sprint planning is about to start, you open the planning poker tool, and... it wants you to log in. Then it asks for a team plan. And suddenly your focus is gone.

That was us—until we found [Planfree.dev](https://planfree.dev).

## The Friction We Didn't Need

As a small dev team, we thrive on fast feedback loops and simplicity. The last thing we want is to waste time jumping through hoops just to estimate a few stories. Most tools we tried felt like they were built for sales demos, not real teams doing real work.

That changed when someone on our team casually dropped a link to Planfree.dev during a meeting.

> “It’s free. Just open it. No login.”

They were right.

## What Makes Planfree.dev Different?

The first thing we noticed: **no distractions**. You land on the site, create a room, and you’re estimating in seconds. It just works. No tutorials. No onboarding emails. No feature bloat.

Here's what stood out:

- **Zero setup** — Create a room instantly
- **No accounts** — Privacy and speed by default
- **Free forever** — No trial countdowns or usage limits
- **Clear UX** — Designed for focus and speed

It's become a ritual now—open Planfree.dev, drop the link in Slack, and get estimating.

## Built for Developers, by Developers

One of the best parts? Planfree.dev is open-source. That means if we ever wanted to self-host or tweak it, we could. But honestly, the hosted version is so smooth, we haven’t needed to.

It’s rare to find a tool this polished that doesn’t try to sell you a "pro" tier after two uses.

## A Better Way to Estimate

We’re not saying Planfree.dev is going to change your life. But it will make sprint planning suck a lot less—and that’s a win.

If your team does estimation and you’ve been fighting against clunky tools or unnecessary subscriptions, give it a go. [Planfree.dev](https://planfree.dev) might be the tool you didn’t know you needed.
