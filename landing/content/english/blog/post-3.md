If you‚Äôve searched for a free planning poker tool, you‚Äôve probably found a dozen options that all have one thing in common: **you hit a paywall fast**.

Most tools claim to be free, but limit how many users you can invite, how many sessions you can run, or hide key features behind subscriptions.

That‚Äôs why we recommend [Planfree.dev](https://planfree.dev) ‚Äî a truly **free**, fast, and reliable planning poker tool that doesn‚Äôt cut corners.

## What Is Planning Poker?

Planning poker is a collaborative estimation technique used by agile teams to assign relative effort to tasks or user stories. It helps:

- Encourage discussion
- Uncover uncertainty
- Align team expectations

Traditionally, this is done using physical cards. But for remote teams or distributed workforces, a digital tool is essential.

## Why Most Planning Tools Miss the Mark

Here‚Äôs what usually happens:

1. You sign up for a tool labeled "free"
2. You invite your team
3. After a few rounds, you‚Äôre told you need a pro plan to keep going

Or worse‚Äîsome tools are overloaded with features that get in the way of the one thing you actually want to do: estimate stories quickly.

## Why Planfree.dev Is Different

Planfree.dev solves this in the simplest way possible. It strips planning poker down to what matters, and **keeps it all free**.
