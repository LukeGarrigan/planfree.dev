Every sprint, our team would groan when it was time to do estimations. Not because of the work—but because of the **tools**.

We’d spend more time trying to log in, manage invites, or figure out why a feature was suddenly paywalled than actually estimating.

So I built my own.

## What I Wanted (That Didn’t Exist)

- A clean, fast UI
- No login walls
- No premium tiers or limited “free trials”
- Just open the site, plan, and leave

That turned into [Planfree.dev](https://planfree.dev).

## From Hack to Habit

At first, it was just for our team. But I shared it publicly, and something unexpected happened: people started using it. Then teams. Then strangers messaging me on GitHub. Now, **hundreds of teams** use it every day.

I’ve kept it open-source, community-driven, and completely free. Because that’s what I wanted in the first place.

## Why Free?

Because not everything needs to be monetised. Because devs deserve better tools. And because sometimes, building something useful is reward enough.

Try it out at [Planfree.dev](https://planfree.dev) — and let me know what you think.
